  "Note.Summary": "Summary... Watch the music box, Mangle’s aggression, Toy duo’s teamwork, and mask timing. Toy Freddy, Foxy and Balloon Boy are threats, and old Freddy and Mangle are slow to leave!",

  "Note.Night1.Part1": "I need to make sure that I keep the music box wound up!",
  "Note.Night1.Part2": "Mangle seems to be more aggressive than usual...",
  "Note.Night1.Part3": "Toy Bonnie and Toy Chica are trying to gang up on me. Maybe I can time putting on my mask with Mangle to knock all three out at once.",
